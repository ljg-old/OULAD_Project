## Overview

The number of e-learning platforms has been exponentially growing over the past years (EdX, Coursera, LinkedIn, Duolingo, Miríadax, CodeAcademy, DataCamp, Mimo, Google Academy...).

Since e-learning is a growing business, learning analytics is becoming a very important part in order to make a difference.

We get information about users and every interaction they make with the Virtual Learning Environment. We can analyze all this data later on and using to either classify our students/customers or predict their success.

This way, we will be able to constantly improve our e-learning platform, our methodology, our syllabus and many more aspects of the educational product.

In this project, we will be aplying prediction algorithms.
